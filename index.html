        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p> I'm Samuel, a French (although after 10 years spent abroad I feel more european than anything else) tech and business person, as well as a nature enthusiast. </p>
				<!-- <p> I currently work in the global markets division of <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/uk/en.html"> Credit Suisse</a>, a leading investment bank. </p>-->
    				<p> I hope that my time spent in Canada (where I did my undergrad), Argentina, Israel, the UK (postgrad), and Switzerland contributed to give me an open minded and organised personality. At least, it enabled me to meet exceptional people. </p>
				<p> Building on my understanding of business/finance, experience in computer engineering, and most importantly imagination, I am willing to take small steps towards great achievements. Blockchain, the focus of my studies at <a href=ïmperial.ac.uk">Imperial College</a>, is the ideal field for that matter. </p>
				<p> I developed an innovative Bitcoin based P2P Hotspot Market, and have been offering consulting services on blockchain related topic for over a year. One of my specialties is enabling you to integrate cryptocurrency payment facilities in your web- or brick and mortar- based business (it's free). </p> 		
				<p> <b> Let’s build something together! </b> </p>
