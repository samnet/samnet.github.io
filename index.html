        		<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p> I'm Samuel, a French (although after 10 years spent abroad I feel more european than anything else) tech and finance person, as well as a nature enthusiast. </p>
				<p> I currently work in the global markets division of <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/uk/en.html"> Credit Suisse</a>, a leading investment bank. </p>
    				<p> I hope that my time spent in Canada (where I did my undergrad), Argentina, the UK (postgrad), and Switzerland contributed to give me an open minded and organised personality. Certainly, it enabled me to meet exceptional people. </p>
				<p> Building on my understanding of business/finance (I achieved financial independence quite early), experience in computer engineering, and most importantly imagination, I am willing to take small steps towards great achievements. Blockchain, the focus of my studies at Imperial College, is the ideal field for that matter. </p>
				<p> I developed an innovative Bitcoin based P2P Hotspot Market, and have been offering consulting services on blockchain realted topic for 1.5 years now. One of my specialties is enabling you to integrate cryptocurrency payment facilities in your web- or brick and mortar- based business (I will even make it for free provided you sell something I like). </p> 		
				<p> <em> Letâ€™s build something together! </em> </p>
